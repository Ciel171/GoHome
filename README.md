# GoHome

我的祖父患有严重的老年痴呆症，总是喜欢往家外面跑，一天要在外散步三四趟才肯回家。但由于他的疾病，他经常走丢，记不清回家的路。

目前市面上有各种各样的导航工具，但这些工具对像我的祖父一样的老年痴呆症患者来说实在过于复杂，对于这些人来说，学会接听电话都是一件极其困难的事情。
该项目的设计初衷就是希望能制作出一款极其简单的导航功能，越简单越好，能让像我的祖父的患者只需要按一个按钮就能跟着导航找到回家的路。

此外，与主流使用java来编程的导航app不同，该项目只使用python语言编写(因为我喜欢python)。

P.S. 导航我使用的是百度API，因为 googlemap 和 openrouteservice 中的中国地图显示不全，找不到我家。如果你有其他偏好的导航api，请随意替换。

    目前v0.1功能实现了：
    导航+语音播报 （终点设置为“家”）
    
    未来v0.2计划更新：
    将百度默认的语音播报的声音替换为我祖母（患者亲近的人）的声音，这样希望患者在使用该app的时候心理上更容易相信导航

This is a simple Python turn-by-turn navigation tool to help my grandfather and everyone with AD (Alzheimer's disease)/dementia to go HOME.

My grandfather suffers from severe dementia and often wanders outside, taking three or four walks a day before willing to return home. Due to his condition, he frequently gets lost and cannot remember the way back.

There are various navigation tools available in the market, but they are too complex for dementia patients like my grandfather. For people like him, even answering a phone call is an extremely challenging task. The primary purpose of this project is to create an extremely simple navigation feature, the simpler, the better. It should allow patients like my grandfather to find their way home with just the press of a button.

In addition, unlike mainstream navigation apps programmed in Java, this project is exclusively written in the Python language because of my preference for Python. As a side note, I use Baidu API for navigation because Google Maps and OpenRouteService do not fully display the map of China, making it difficult to locate my home. If you have a preference for other navigation APIs, feel free to replace it.

        As of version 0.1, the following features have been implemented:
        Navigation with voice prompts (setting the destination as "home").

        Future plans for version 0.2 include:
        Replacing the default Baidu voice prompt with the voice of my grandmother (a person close to the patient), 
        in the hope that patients will find the navigation more trustworthy when they hear a familiar voice.
